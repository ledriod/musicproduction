### The Sine Wave

The weight in picture moves in what is called simple harmonic motion. Vibration or oscillation is possible because 
of the elasticity of the spring and the inertia of the weight.

__Propagation of Sound__

The speed of sound in air is about 1,240 km/hr at normal temperature and pressure.

the pressure at the crests is higher than the prevailing atmospheric barometric pressure and the troughs lower than the atmospheric pressure, as shown in the sine wave of picture. These fluctuations of pressure are very small indeed. The faintest sound the ear can hear (20 Î¼Pa) exists at a pressure some 5,000 million times smaller than atmospheric pressure. Normal speech and music signals are represented by correspondingly small ripples superimposed on the atmospheric pressure.


### Waves

__Wavelength and Frequency__

A sine wave is illustrated

Wavelength (m) = Speed of sound (m/sec) / Frequency (Hz)

Frequency (Hz) = Speed of sound / Wavelength


__Complex Waves__

Combining A and B at each point in time, the waveshape graph (C) is obtained. The process can be reversed.

The complex waveform (E) can be disassembled to the simple f1 , f2 , and f3 sine components by either acoustical or electronic filters.
