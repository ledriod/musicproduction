## The Sine Wave

The weight in picture moves in what is called simple harmonic motion. Vibration or oscillation is possible because 
of the elasticity of the spring and the inertia of the weight.

__Propagation of Sound__

![img](L1-Basis/L1-Basis-02-02.jpg)

The speed of sound in air is about 1,240 km/hr at normal temperature and pressure.

the pressure at the crests is higher than the prevailing atmospheric barometric pressure and the troughs lower than the atmospheric pressure, as shown in the sine wave of picture. These fluctuations of pressure are very small indeed. The faintest sound the ear can hear (20 μPa) exists at a pressure some 5,000 million times smaller than atmospheric pressure. Normal speech and music signals are represented by correspondingly small ripples superimposed on the atmospheric pressure.


## Waves

__Wavelength and Frequency__

A sine wave is illustrated

Wavelength (m) = Speed of sound (m/sec) / Frequency (Hz)

Frequency (Hz) = Speed of sound / Wavelength


__Complex Waves__

Combining A and B at each point in time, the waveshape graph (C) is obtained. The process can be reversed.

The complex waveform (E) can be disassembled to the simple f1 , f2 , and f3 sine components by either acoustical or electronic filters. 


__Phase__

In previouse picture, all three components, f1 , f2 , and f3 , start from zero together. This is called an in-phase condition.

the crankshaft of an automobile engine was equated with one cycle of simple harmonic motion of the piston.

- One complete sine-wave cycle represents 360° of rotation. 
- sine wave of identical frequency is delayed 90°, its time relationship to the first one is a quarter wave late
- A half-wave delay would be 180°, and so on. 
- For the 360° delay, the waveform synchronizes with the top one, reaching positive peaks and negative peaks simultaneously and producing the in-phase condition.



## Harmonic analysis

[wiki: Harmonic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis)

Harmonic analysis is a branch of mathematics concerned with the representation of functions or signals as the superposition of basic waves, and the study of and generalization of the notions of Fourier series and Fourier transforms (i.e. an extended form of Fourier analysis).

__Harmonics__

- 100 Hz, base signal
- 200 Hz, 2 harmonic
- 300 Hz, 3 harmonic
- 400 Hz, 4 harmonic
- 500 Hz, 5 harmonic
- 600 Hz, 6 harmonic
- 700 Hz, 7 harmonic
- 800 Hz, 8 harmonic


__Spectrum__

The commonly accepted scope of the audible spectrum is 20 Hz to 20 kHz; the range is one of the specific characteristics of the human ear. Here, in the context of sine waves and harmonics, we need to establish the concept of spectrum.

several waveform have been captured from the screen of an oscilloscope. To the right of each capture is the spectrum of that particular signal. The spectrum tells how the energy of the signal is distributed in frequency.

the spectrum of the square wave shown in picture, graph(C).

picture shows a square wave; it can be synthesized by adding harmonics to a fundamental. However, many harmonics would be needed. For example, graph(B) shows the waveform that results from adding two nonzero harmonic components, and graph(C) shows the result from adding nine nonzero harmonic components. This demonstrates why a bandlimited “square wave” does not have a square appearance.



## Electrical, Mechanical, and Acoustical waves

An acoustical system can be represented in terms of an equivalent electrical or mechanical system, the mathematical approach is the same for different oscillators.
