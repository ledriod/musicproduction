## Audio sampling

An analogue audio signal is a time-continuous electrical waveform and the A/D convertor’s task is to turn this signal into a time-discrete sequence of binary numbers. The sampling process employed in an A/D convertor involves the measurement or ‘sampling’ of the amplitude of the audio waveform at regular intervals in time (see Figure 8.7). From this diagram it will be clear that the sample pulses represent the instantaneous amplitudes of the audio signal at each point in time.
